This is a simple app that allows you to track your expenses. You can add, edit, and delete expenses. The app also shows you the total amount of money you have spent.

To get started, open the app in your browser. You will see a header with the total amount of money you have spent. Below the header, you will see a list of your expenses. Each expense has a description, a price, and a date.

To add an expense, click the "AÃ±adir" button. A form will appear where you can enter the description, price, and date of the expense. When you are finished, click the "Agregar Gasto" button.

To edit an expense, click the "editar" button on the expense you want to edit. The form will reappear where you can change the description, price, and date of the expense. When you are finished, click the "Guardar Cambios" button.

To delete an expense, click the "eliminar" button on the expense you want to delete. The expense will be removed from the list.

The app is responsive, so it can be used on devices of all sizes.
